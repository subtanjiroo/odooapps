    <p><strong>AI-powered insights and automation for Odoo.</strong></p>

    <h2>About Leandix AI</h2>
    <p>
      Leandix AI is a powerful Odoo module designed to integrate artificial intelligence seamlessly into your ERP system. 
      It enhances user productivity by automating repetitive tasks and provides intelligent insights by bridging the gap between your business data and AI capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When using Leandix AI, selected business data (such as chat prompts, relevant model fields, or context-specific metadata) will be securely transmitted to a remote AI processing server (via API) for analysis and response generation. This allows AI services to understand your context and deliver accurate results.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Leandix AI prioritizes the security and confidentiality of your business data. Only necessary and context-specific data will be sent to the external AI server for processing. All data transfers are performed via secure encrypted HTTPS channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data is not stored</strong> permanently on the AI server unless explicitly configured or permitted by the user. For full control, you can manage API key usage and endpoint settings under the Leandix AI configuration panel in Odoo.

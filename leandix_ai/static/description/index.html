    <h1>Leandix AI</h1>
    <p><strong>AI-powered insights and automation for Odoo.</strong></p>

    <h2>About Leandix AI</h2>
    <p>
      Leandix AI is a powerful Odoo module designed to integrate artificial intelligence seamlessly into your ERP system. 
      It enhances user productivity by automating repetitive tasks and provides intelligent insights by bridging the gap between your business data and AI capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When using Leandix AI, selected business data (such as chat prompts, relevant model fields, or context-specific metadata) will be securely transmitted to a remote AI processing server (via API) for analysis and response generation. This allows AI services to understand your context and deliver accurate results.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Leandix AI prioritizes the security and confidentiality of your business data. Only necessary and context-specific data will be sent to the external AI server for processing. All data transfers are performed via secure encrypted HTTPS channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data is not stored</strong> permanently on the AI server unless explicitly configured or permitted by the user. For full control, you can manage API key usage and endpoint settings under the Leandix AI configuration panel in Odoo.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>External AI Processing:</strong> Securely sends relevant Odoo data to an external AI server for intelligent analysis and real-time responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure by Design:</strong> Data access and AI interactions follow strict security protocols to protect your sensitive business information.</li>
      <li><strong>AI & User Friendly:</strong> Designed to be intuitive for end-users and optimized for interaction with modern AI models (like GPT, Claude, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Deep Odoo-AI Integration:</strong> Built to help AI understand Odoo's business models, data structures, and workflows—enabling smarter automation and more relevant responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Chat UI:</strong> A sleek and responsive AI chat interface integrated directly into the Odoo backend.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Model Support:</strong> Easily connect with different AI providers and switch models as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Case Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Auto-generate sales insights or reports from historical Odoo data.</li>
      <li>Answer internal team questions using company-specific context.</li>
      <li>Simplify onboarding by letting AI explain menus and workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Guide</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permissions Required:</strong> Ensure that the user has been granted the necessary access rights to use Leandix AI features.</li>
      <li><strong>Be as detailed as possible:</strong> When asking AI a question, try to include as much relevant detail as possible, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Which module is involved?</li>
          <li>When did the issue occur?</li>
          <li>How many records or cases are affected?</li>
          <li>Any related data or conditions?</li>
        </ul>
        Providing specific context helps the AI understand your request better and deliver more accurate responses.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ensure complete setup:</strong> Make sure all required modules are installed and the system has sufficient business data for the AI to analyze and assist effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Leandix AI may have limitations in returning very long or exhaustive results. Therefore, it’s better to ask clearly focused questions. If you want to explore all module details, it’s often more effective to review them directly in Odoo.</li>
    </ul>
